## Stanford Algorithm's Class - Professor Tim Roughgarden

### Week 1: Notes:

1. Big-O:  Upper Bound.  Tn (number of operations) is less than or equal to Big-O
  * Big-O is upper bound.  
    1. Declare C & n'.  Above n', Tn is ALWAYS less than Big-O

  * Big-O suppresses constant factors & lower order terms
    1. Constant factors ignored since system dependent
    2. Lower order terms ignored since irrelevant when n is very large

2. Omega Notation:  Lower Bound.  Tn (number of operations) is greater than or equal to Theta

3.  Theta = Equality

4.  "Little-o":  Strictly less than.  Never equal
